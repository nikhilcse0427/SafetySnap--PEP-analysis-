```

---

## 📊 After Deployment

1. **MongoDB Atlas Setup:**
   - Go to MongoDB Atlas → Network Access
   - Add IP: `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow all)
   - This lets Vercel connect to your database

2. **Custom Domain (Optional):**
   - Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS instructions

3. **Monitor:**
   - Check Vercel Analytics
   - View function logs
   - Monitor MongoDB usage

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitation

**File Uploads:** Vercel has read-only filesystem. Uploaded images work during the session but won't persist. 

**Solution:** Integrate cloud storage (Cloudinary, AWS S3, or Vercel Blob) for production use.

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Build fails?**
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

**Can't connect to database?**
- Verify MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist includes 0.0.0.0/0
- Check connection string format

**API not working?**
- Verify environment variables are set
- Check vercel.json routes configuration

---

## 🎊 You're Ready!

Just run:
```bash
vercel login
vercel
vercel --prod
```

**Good luck with your deployment! 🚀**
