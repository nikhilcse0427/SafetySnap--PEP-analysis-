# ✅ Build Error Fixed!

## 🐛 Issue
The Vercel build was failing with this error:
```
Line 15:6: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: 'fetchAnalysis'. 
Either include it or remove the dependency array react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
```

## 🔧 Solution Applied
Moved the `fetchAnalysis` function **inside** the `useEffect` hook to resolve the dependency warning.

### Before (❌ Error):
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  fetchAnalysis();
}, [id]);

const fetchAnalysis = async () => {
  // fetch logic
};
```

### After (✅ Fixed):
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchAnalysis = async () => {
    // fetch logic
  };
  
  fetchAnalysis();
}, [id]);
```

## 🚀 What Happens Next

1. **Code pushed to GitHub** ✅
2. **Vercel will auto-detect the change** 
3. **Automatic redeployment will start**
4. **Build should succeed now**

## 📊 Check Deployment Status

Go to your Vercel dashboard:
- https://vercel.com/dashboard

You should see:
- 🟡 Building... (in progress)
- 🟢 Ready (when complete)

## ⏱️ Timeline

- Push to GitHub: **Done** ✅
- Vercel detects change: ~30 seconds
- Build starts: Automatic
- Build completes: ~2-3 minutes
- Site goes live: Automatic

## 🌐 Your Live URL

Once deployment completes, your app will be at:
```
https://safety-snap-pep-analysis-main.vercel.app
```
(or similar - check your Vercel dashboard for exact URL)

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Wait for build to complete** (~2-3 minutes)
2. **Check Vercel dashboard** for deployment status
3. **Test your live app** at the provided URL
4. **Verify all features work:**
   - Domain selection
