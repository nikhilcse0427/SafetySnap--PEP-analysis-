# 🔧 Backend "Not Found" Error - FIXED

## What Was Wrong
- Server wasn't exporting properly for Vercel
- Routes configuration was too complex
- Upload paths were incorrect

## What I Fixed
1. ✅ Added `module.exports = app` for Vercel
2. ✅ Simplified routes in `vercel.json`
3. ✅ Fixed uploads directory path
4. ✅ Updated server to work with Vercel serverless functions

## 🚀 How to Deploy Fixed Backend

### Step 1: Commit and Push Changes

```bash
cd c:\Users\Hp\Desktop\project\server

git add .
git commit -m "Fix backend for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Vercel Will Auto-Deploy

- Vercel will detect the changes
- Automatic redeployment will start
- Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Test Backend

Visit these URLs (replace with YOUR backend URL):

**Health Check:**
```
https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/health
```
Should return: `{"status":"OK","message":"SafetySnap API is running"}`

**Test Upload Endpoint:**
```
https://your-backend.vercel.app/api/upload
```
Should return error (since no image), but confirms route exists

## 📝 Alternative: Manual Redeploy

If auto-deploy doesn't trigger:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your backend project
3. Go to "Deployments" tab
4. Click "..." on latest deployment
5. Click "Redeploy"
6. Uncheck "Use existing Build Cache"
7. Click "Redeploy"

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After redeployment:

- [ ] Backend URL loads without error
- [ ] `/api/health` returns success message
- [ ] No "404 Not Found" errors
- [ ] Environment variables are set:
  - MONGODB_URI
  - PORT
  - NODE_ENV
  - FRONTEND_URL (add after frontend is deployed)

## 🐛 If Still Getting Errors

Check Vercel Function Logs:

1. Go to your backend project in Vercel
2. Click on latest deployment
3. Scroll to "Function Logs"
4. Look for error messages

Common issues:
- Missing environment variables
